#  ActivityMon Core
Draft Specification

 - - -

##  Abstract  ##

This specification describes the core requirements for the [ActivityMon][] extension to [ActivityPub][].
In particular, it deliniates the basic processing requirements for [Mon Vocabulary][] objects sent across the [ActivityPub][] protocol.

 - - -

##  1. Introduction  ##

The [Mon Vocabulary][] specifies a vocabulary for describing *mon*â€”fictitious, collectable entities that can perform actions, and outline basic processing requirements in an [ActivityStreams 2.0][] context.
This specification extends that work into the [ActivityPub][] protocol, helping to make federated mon collection into a reality.

###  1.1 Relationship to Other Specifications

This document is part of the [ActivityMon][] set of specifications.
Any process claiming to implement ActivityMon must conform to this specification.

This document uses the vocabulary defined in the [Mon Vocabulary][] specification.

This document defines an [ActivityPub][] extension, and depends upon both the [Activity Vocabulary][] and [ActivityStreams 2.0][].

###  1.2 Notational Conventions

[Activity Vocabulary][] types are indicated with the prefix `as:`, which represents the `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#` base URI.
Note that in [ActivityStreams 2.0][] documents, this prefix **MAY** be omitted.

Mon Vocabulary types are indicated with no prefix `mon:`, which represents the `tag:marrus.xyz,2018:activitymon::` base URI.
Note that in [ActivityStreams 2.0][] documents, this prefix **MUST** be declared in the `@context` of the document to be valid, and a different prefix **MAY** be used instead.

##  2. Conformance  ##

All sections explicitly marked as non-normative, as well as any diagrams, exmaples, or notes in this specification, are non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.

ActivityMon is an extension of [ActivityPub][] and inherits its conformance requirements, including its conformance classes.
Every conforming ActivityMon implementation **MUST** also be a conforming ActivityPub implementation.

Implementations are **NOT REQUIRED** to follow the steps of algorithms defined in this specification exactly, so long as the implemented algorithm produces the same result.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **NOT RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119][].

##  3. Actors and Objects  ##

ActivityMon servers are **REQUIRED** to recognize objects of type `mon:Mon` and `mon:Trainer` as actors.
ActivityMon servers **MAY** treat `as:Person` objects as though a type of `mon:Trainer` were specified if no other Mon Actor Type is present.
ActivityMon servers **SHOULD** ignore any unrecognized types on objects for whom a Mon Actor Type is specified.

`mon:Trainer` Actor objects **SHOULD** have a `mon:mon` property.
This is a list of all of the `mon:Mon` which an actor has successfully `mon:Capture`d, added as a side effect.
The `mon:mon` collection **MUST** be either an `mon:OrderedCollection` or a `mon:Collection` and **MAY** be filtered on privileges of an authenticated user or as appropriate when no authentication is given.
ActivityMon servers **MUST NOT** include `mon:Mon` that they do not control in the collection referenced by the `mon:mon` property of a `mon:Trainer` that they do.

 >  **Example:**
 >  A server with a concept of a "party" might hide all non-party `mon:Mon` from a `mon:mon` collection for non-authenticated users.

###  3.1  Cloning Objects

This section sets forth processing rules for cloning certain types of ActivityMon object.
When cloning objects, implementations **MAY** assign or copy over additional properties or values, so long as the resulting object still conforms to the [Mon Vocabulary][] specification.

####  3.1.1  Cloning `mon:Item` objects

To clone a `mon:Item` object, a server **SHOULD** take the following steps:

1.  Create a new object with type `mon:Item`.

2.  For each additional type on the original object which the server recognizes, assign this type to the new object.
    Servers **MAY** also copy over additional types.

3.  Set the values of `as:content`, `as:name`, `as:summary`, `mon:health`, `mon:maxHealth`, and `mon:probablity` to match their values on the original object, if valid.

####  3.1.2  Cloning `mon:Stat` objects

To clone a `mon:Stat` object, a server **SHOULD** take the following steps:

1.  Create a new object with type `mon:Stat`.

2.  For each additional type on the original object which the server recognizes, assign this type to the new object.
    Servers **MAY** also copy over additional types.

3.  Set the values of `as:content`, `as:name`, `as:summary`, and `mon:level` to match their values on the original object, if valid.

####  3.1.3  Cloning `mon:Technique` objects

To clone a `mon:Technique` object, a server **SHOULD** take the following steps:

1.  Create a new object with type `mon:Technique`.

2.  Set the values of `as:content`, `as:name`, `as:summary`, `mon:maxHealth`, `mon:probability`, and `mon:power` to match their values in the original object, if valid.

3.  Set the values of `mon:affinity` and `mon:effect` to match any valid values for these properties in the original object which are recognized by the server.
    Servers **MAY** additionally copy over unrecognized values.

4.  For each `mon:Stat` object in the `mon:usesStat` property of the original object, clone the `mon:Stat` object and assign it to the `mon:usesStat` property of the new object.
    When cloning the `mon:Stat` object for this purpose, servers **SHOULD NOT** set the `mon:level` property.

####  3.1.4  Cloning `mon:Species` objects

To clone a `mon:Species` object, a server **SHOULD** take the following steps:

1.  Create a new object with type `mon:Species`.

2.  Set the values of `as:content`, `as:name`, `as:summary`, and `mon:maxHealth` to match their value in the original object, if valid.

3.  Set the values of `mon:ability`, `mon:affinity`, `mon:forme`, and `mon:nature` to match any valid values for these properties in the original object which are recognized by the server.
    Servers **MAY** additionally copy over unrecognized values.

4.  For each `mon:GrowthFunc` in the `mon:growth` property of the original object, create a new `mon:GrowthFunc` object with identical values for the `mon:maxLevel`, `mon:minLevel`, `mon:n0`, `mon:n1`, `mon:n2`, and `mon:n3` properties, if valid, and assign it to the `mon:growth` property of the new object.

5.  For each `mon:Learned` in the `mon:learnset` property of the original object, execute the following steps:

    1.  Attempt to fetch the resource pointed to by the `mon:technique` property, if valid.
        If the `mon:technique` property is not valid, or the resulting resource is not a `mon:Technique`, abort these steps.
        Otherwise, clone the resulting `mon:Technique`.

    2.  Create a new object with type `mon:Learned`.

    3.  Set the value of `mon:level` to match the value in the original object, if valid.

    4.  Set the value of `mon:technique` to link to the `mon:Technique` cloned in these steps.

    5.  Assign this `mon:Learned` object to the `mon:learnset` property of the new `mon:Species`.

6.  For each `mon:Stat` object in the `mon:stats` property of the original object, clone the `mon:Stat` object and assign it to the `mon:stats` property of the new object.

####  3.1.5  Cloning `mon:Mon` objects

To clone a `mon:Mon` object, a server **SHOULD** take the following steps:

1.  Create a new Actor with type `mon:Mon`.

2.  Attempt to fetch any resources pointed to by the `as:generator` property, if valid, and take the union of these resources and all `as:Object`s assigned to this property.
    If any of a `mon:Item`, `mon:Region`, `mon:Route`, or `mon:Trainer` exists among these objects, link to them on the `as:generator` property of the new object, after first cloning the `mon:Item`, if applicable.
    If multiple exist of the same type, only link one.

3.  Attempt to fetch any resources pointed to by the `as:context` property of the original `mon:Mon`, if valid, and take the union of these resources and all `as:Object`s assigned to this property.
    If there is exactly one `mon:Species` among these objects, clone it and link to it on the `as:context` property of the new object.

4.  Set the values of `as:content`, `as:name`, `as:summary`, `mon:exp`, `mon:health`, `mon:level` and `mon:maxHealth` to match their values in the original object, if valid.

5.  Set the values of `mon:ability`, `mon:affinity`, `mon:effect`, `mon:forme`, and `mon:nature` to match any valid values for these properties in the original object which are recognized by the server.
    Servers **MAY** additionally copy over unrecognized values.

6.  For each `mon:GrowthFunc` in the `mon:growth` property of the original object, create a new `mon:GrowthFunc` object with identical values for the `mon:maxLevel`, `mon:minLevel`, `mon:n0`, `mon:n1`, `mon:n2`, and `mon:n3` properties, if valid, and assign it to the `mon:growth` property of the new object.

7.  If the value `mon:learned` property on the original object is a singular `as:OrderedCollection`, create a new `as:OrderedCollection` and assign it to the `mon:learned` property of the new object.
    Then, for each `mon:Learned` object in the original `as:OrderedCollection`, execute the following steps:

    1.  Attempt to fetch the resource pointed to by the `mon:technique` property, if valid.
        If the `mon:technique` property is not valid, or the resulting resource is not a `mon:Technique`, abort these steps.
        Otherwise, clone the resulting `mon:Technique`.

    2.  Create a new object with type `mon:Learned`.

    3.  Set the value of `mon:health` to match the value in the original object, if valid.

    4.  Set the value of `mon:technique` to link to the `mon:Technique` cloned in these steps.

    5.  Add this `mon:Learned` object to the new `as:OrderedCollection` object assigned to `mon:learned`.

8.  For each `mon:Learned` in the `mon:learnset` property of the original object, execute the following steps:

    1.  Attempt to fetch the resource pointed to by the `mon:technique` property, if valid.
        If the `mon:technique` property is not valid, or the resulting resource is not a `mon:Technique`, abort these steps.
        Otherwise, clone the resulting `mon:Technique`.

    2.  Create a new object with type `mon:Learned`.

    3.  Set the value of `mon:level` to match the value in the original object, if valid.

    4.  Set the value of `mon:technique` to link to the `mon:Technique` cloned in these steps.

    5.  Assign this `mon:Learned` object to the `mon:learnset` property of the new `mon:Mon`.

9.  For each `mon:Stat` object in the `mon:statExp` property of the original object, clone the `mon:Stat` object and assign it to the `mon:statExp` property of the new object.

10.  For each `mon:Stat` object in the `mon:statInd` property of the original object, clone the `mon:Stat` object and assign it to the `mon:statInd` property of the new object.

11.  For each `mon:Stat` object in the `mon:stats` property of the original object, clone the `mon:Stat` object and assign it to the `mon:stats` property of the new object.

##  4. Client to Server Interactions  ##

The credentials used to authenticate a request to a `mon:Trainer` **SHOULD** also authenticate requests to any `mon:Mon` in the `mon:mon` collection of that `mon:Trainer`.
(In other words, a `mon:Trainer` **SHOULD** be able to make requests on behalf of their `mon:Mon`).

However, servers **MAY** restrict `mon:Mon` authentication to only allow certain activities.

>  **Example:** A server may allow users to generate `mon:Use` activities on behalf of their mon, but disallow them from `as:Create`ing posts.

###  4.1 The `as:Delete` Activity

Servers **SHOULD** replace deleted `mon:Region`s, `mon:Route`s, `mon:Species`, and `mon:Technique`s with `as:Tombstone`s.
Servers **SHOULD NOT** replace deleted `mon:Item`s with `as:Tombstone`s.

###  4.2 The `as:Follow` Activity

The `as:Follow` activity, in addition to its semantics under [ActivityPub][], is used to travel to a `mon:Route`.
`mon:Route`s **MUST NOT** be the `as:actor` of an `as:Follow` whose `as:object` is also a `mon:Route`, and servers **MUST NOT** dispatch any such activities.

If the `as:object` of this activity is a `mon:Route`, then after receiving this in an **outbox**, the server **SHOULD** do the following:

1.  Remove any `as:Route`s, or links thereof, from the `as:location` property of the `as:object`.
2.  If there are any `as:Route`s in the `as:following` collection of the `as:actor`, generate and dispatch `as:Undo` activities to undo these `as:Follow`s, handling them exactly as if they had been delivered to the **outbox** by a client.

The above steps **MUST NOT** be undone in the case of an `as:Undo`.
Servers **MAY** delay these steps until after an `as:Accept` activity is subsequently received with this `as:Follow` activity as its `as:object`.

###  4.3 The `as:Undo` Activity

The `mon:Capture`, `mon:Search`, and `mon:Use` activities cannot be undone after an `as:Accept` activity has been received, and servers **MUST NOT** allow `as:Undo` activities for such objects.
However, `as:Undo`s **MAY** be generated for these activities while they are still pending, to cancel the attempt.

###  4.4 The `mon:Capture` Activity

The `mon:Capture` activity makes an attempt to capture a mon.

Upon receiving a `mon:Capture` activity in an **outbox**, servers **SHOULD**, at minimum, decrement the value of the `mon:health` property on any `mon:Item` or `mon:Learned` objects in the `as:instrument`, if present, valid, and nonzero.
Servers **MAY** wait to apply these effects until after an `as:Accept` activity is subsequently received with this `mon:Capture` activity as its `as:object`.

###  4.5 The `mon:Search` Activity

The `mon:Search` activity makes an attempt to capture a mon.

Upon receiving a `mon:Search` activity in an **outbox**, servers **SHOULD**, at minimum, decrement the value of the `mon:health` property on any `mon:Item` or `mon:Learned` objects in the `as:instrument`, if present, valid, and nonzero.
Servers **MAY** wait to apply these effects until after an `as:Accept` activity is subsequently received with this `mon:Search` activity as its `as:object`.

##  4. Server to Server Interactions  ##

As with Client to Server interactions, ActivityMon both specifies additional Activities with special behaviour under client to server interactions, and specifies additional restrictions and processing behaviours for those defined by [ActivityPub][].

###  4.1 The `as:Arrive` Activity

The `as:Arrive` activity is used to announce the arrival of its `as:actor` at an `as:location`.
In ActivityMon, this **MAY** be used to signal successful arrival at a `mon:Route`.

Upon receiving an `as:Arrive` activity in an **inbox**, servers **SHOULD** update its copy of the object with the same `@id` as specified by the activity's `as:actor`, to ensure that the location change is recorded.

###  4.2 The `as:Follow` Activity

Upon receiving an `as:Follow` activity in an **inbox**, servers **MUST** generate and deliver an `as:Reject` if both the `as:actor` and `as:object` are of type `mon:Route`.

 >  **Note:** Like with any follow, servers can generate an `as:Reject` for `as:Follow` activities whose `as:object` are of type `mon:Route` for other reasons as well.
 >  For example, a server might only `as:Accept` attempts to access a `mon:Route` if the `as:actor` is a `mon:Trainer` with a certain number of gym badges.

In the case of receiving an `as:Accept` referencing this `as:Follow` activity as its object, the server **SHOULD**, as a side effect, add the `as:object` to the `as:location` property of the `as:actor` if it is a `mon:Route` or a link thereof.

###  4.3 The `as:Undo` Activity

After receiving an `as:Undo` activity in an **inbox**, servers **SHOULD NOT** generate an `as:Accept` or `as:Reject` for the `as:object`.

###  4.4 The `mon:Capture` Activity

A `mon:Capture` activity attempts to capture a mon.

Upon receiving a `mon:Capture` activity in an **inbox**, a server should generate either an `as:Accept` or `as:Reject` activity with the `mon:Capture` as the `as:object` and deliver it to the `as:actor` of the `as:Capture`.
A server **MUST** send an `as:Reject` for any `mon:Capture` whose `as:object` is a `mon:Mon` that is already associated with an owner.

In the case of receiving an `as:Accept` referencing this `mon:Capture` as the `as:object`, for which the `as:actor` is a `mon:Trainer` and the `as:object` is a `mon:Mon`,  the server **SHOULD** perform the following steps:

1.  Clone the `as:object` of the `as:actor` according to the steps for cloning `mon:Mon` outlined above.

2.  Add the `as:actor` of the `mon:Capture` to the `as:attributedTo` and `as:generator` properties of the resulting `mon:Mon`.
    Servers **MAY** add additional values to the `as:generator` property as well.

3.  Add the resulting `mon:Mon` to the `mon:mon` collection of the `as:actor` of the `mon:Capture`.

###  4.4 The `mon:Search` Activity

The `mon:Search` activity makes an attempt to search a `mon:Route`.

Upon receiving a `mon:Search` activity in an **inbox**, a server **SHOULD** generate either an `as:Accept` or `as:Reject` activity with the `mon:Search` as the `as:object` and deliver it to the `as:actor` of the `as:Search`.
An `as:Accept` **SHOULD** include an `as:result` property, whose value is the result of the search.

###  4.5 The `mon:Use` Activity

The `mon:Use` activity makes an attempt to use an object.

If a server "understands" the intended effects of a `Use` activity received in an **inbox**, it **SHOULD** apply those effects and then generate an `as:Accept` activity with the `Use` as the `as:object` and deliver it to the `as:actor` of the `mon:Use`.
Otherwise, the server **SHOULD** generate a `as:Reject` activity with the `Use` as the `as:object` and deliver it to the `as:actor` of the `mon:Use`.

>  **Note:** A server might fail to understand the intended effects of a `Use` activity if the `Use` references an `Item` that the server does not understand, or a `MoveKind` has an unknown `effect`.

In the case of receiving an `as:Accept` referencing this `mon:Use` as the `as:object`, the server **SHOULD** apply any effects resulting from successful use.
In particular, the server **SHOULD**, at minimum, decrement the value of the `mon:health` property on any `mon:Item` or `mon:Learned` objects in the `as:object`, if present, valid, and nonzero.
In the case of an `as:Reject`, the server **SHOULD NOT** apply such effects.
