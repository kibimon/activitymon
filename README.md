This directory contains a number of specifications which define ActivityPub extensions for federated gaming.
These are grouped into two main families:

 +  [RPPub][] defines general vocabularies and behaviours for roleplaying contexts.

 +  [MonStrPub][] defines vocabularies and behaviours for ActivityPub servers which want to support the catching of mon, and their interactions.

These specifications were written by [the KibiMon project][KibiMon], led by [`@kibi@glitch.social`](https://glitch.social/@kibi).
